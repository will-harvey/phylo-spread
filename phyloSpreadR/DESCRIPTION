Title: Analysis of Phylogenetic Trees Describing Spatial Spread
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Will Harvey
Maintainer: Will Harvey <wharvey@ed.ac.uk>
Description: Package exists to provide functions that allow analysis of the spread of an organism through time and space in cases where a phylogenetic tree describes the process (often envisioned as spread of a pathogen during an epidemic)
    Many functions are for post-hoc analysis of continuous phylogeographic analysis where dates and locations have been estimated for interal nodes of the phylogeny.
